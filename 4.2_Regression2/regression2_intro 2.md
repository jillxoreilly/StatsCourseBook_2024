# Multivariate Analysis

This week we introduce the concept of multivariate analysis, and we
will begin to run regression models that have more than one
explanatory variable in Python.


## Tasks for this week
Conceptual material is covered in the lecture. In addition to the live lecture, you can find the lecture recording and additional materials on Canvas.
Please work through the guided exercises in this section (everything except the page labelled “Tutorial Exercises”) in advance of the computer-based tutorial session.
