# ANOVA

Welcome to Trinity Term!

We’ll have three weeks of classes this term, covering Analysis of
Variance, Logistic Regression, and Research Design.

In the third and last tutorial, you will do a practice exam question to help prepare you for the exam.

In week 1 this term, we are learning about Analysis of Variance, known
as ANOVA.

This method of statistical analysis has some overlap with Regression, and we will look at the similarities and differences of the two approaches.


## Tasks for this week
Conceptual material is covered in the lecture. In addition to the live
lecture, you can find the lecture recording and additional materials
on Canvas.

Please work through the guided exercises in this section (everything
except the page labelled “Tutorial Exercises”) in advance of the
computer-based tutorial session.

The tutorial exercises for this week will form the basis of your hand-in assignment.
