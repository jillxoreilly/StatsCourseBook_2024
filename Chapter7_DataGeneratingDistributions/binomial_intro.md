# The Binomial Distribution


Consider the following situations:
<ul>
    <li> a fair coin is tossed 10 times. How likely is it that we obtain exactly 5 heads?
    <li> a fair six sided dice is rolled 3 times. How likely is it that we obtain two or more sixes?
    <li> a blind man guesses whether a symbol on a screen is an X or an O. How likely is it that he guesses correctly at least 22 out of 30 times?
</ul>        


In each case there is an event with two possible outcomes. 

One outcome (the one we are looking for) is designated as a "hit" whilst the other is called a "miss". 

The probability of a hit is a fixed value (<i>p</i>)

The event is repeated a certain number of times (<i>n</i>) and we count the number of times (<i>k</i>) one of the outcomes (the "hit") occurs

In each case we can ask, <b>what is the probability of obtaining
<i>k</i> (or <i>at least k</i>) hits out of <i>n</i> trials, given
that the probability of a hit on any given trial is <i>p</i>?</b>

The probability of each value of <i>k</i> is given by the inomial distribution
