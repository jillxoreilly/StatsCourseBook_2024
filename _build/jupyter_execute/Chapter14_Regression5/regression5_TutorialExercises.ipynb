    "# Tutorial exercises\n",

    "In the tutorial you will be analysing data (real but edited) from the 2021 General Social Survey from the USA.  The General Social Survey is a regular survey of the population of the United States that gathers information on people’s opinions. The sample is intended to be representative of the adult population. The outcome variable of interest (‘afraid’) is whether people feel afraid to walk in their neighbourhoods at night. The question wording was as follows: \"Is there any area around your home--that is, within a mile--where you would be afraid to walk alone at night?\" The answer options are yes (1) or no (0). (Some people also answered “don’t know” but these are set to missing).\n",
    "\n",
    "The $x$ variables are as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sex (male, female)\n",
    "* Age (in years)\n",
    "* Race of respondent (white, black, other)\n",
    "* Born (whether respondent was born in the USA, yes or no)\n",
    "* Raclive (a binary variable indicating whether the neighbourhood is racially mixed).\n",
    "* Educ (education measured in years of education, where more years assumes higher educational qualifications)\n",
    "* Income (an ordinal variable of household income, where higher values mean higher incomes. Treat as continuous for this analysis)\n",
