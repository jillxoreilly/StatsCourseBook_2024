    "Warrington and Weiskrantz (1974) worked with a patient (called in their work by his initials, DB). DB had damage to the visual cortex of his brain, and reported no conscious vision, but Warrington and Weiskrantz noticed some hints that he could react to visual stimuli even though he was unaware of them, so they set up the following experiment:\n",

    "* We would conclude that DB was not guessing if he got an unusually high number of trials correct. We need to determine a cutoff such that if he scored more than the cut-off, we would conclude he had some residual unconscious vision. It is logical that if 22/30 trials correct is sufficient evidence to reject the null, so is 23/30 and 24/30... \n",
