    "# Hand-in Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "You task is to produce a report for the Chair of Medicare (the organization that paid for the hospital stays of the patients in this dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chair of Medicare wants to know what factors affect the cost of a hospital admission for heart attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report will summarise the distribution of costs and the factors that affect the cost of a hospital stay, using appropriate plots and descriptive statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "This report should build on the Tutorial Exercises for session 3, BUT an important part of the task is to prepare a report (as if for presentation to a client, the Chair of Medicare), NOT just paste the tutorial exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions for completing this report\n",
    "\n",
    "You will produce your report in the form of a a Jupyter notebook (you could modify this one or create a new one).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will contain text (to be read by the Chair of Medicare who is not familiar with Python code) and code blocks (showing transparently how you processed the data, in case someone in the Medicare Data Science Team wants to check or elaborate on the analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add as many new blocks as you need to a notebook by clicking the + button in the toolbar at the top of the notebook viewer, then selecting the type (code or markdown, which is text) from the dropdown menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What your report should cover\n",
    "\n",
    "Some suggested sections for the report are included in the <b>stub</b> notebook below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What makes a good report\n",
    "\n",
    "It should contain information useful to the Chair, and this should not be swamped by irrelevant information (ie, do not report every possible correlation and produce every possible graph, but focus on those you think are important)\n",
    "\n",
    "The text blocks should be readable by a non statistically trained person, although they should contain key descriptive statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The text blocks should be supported by code blocks illustraing how you obtained the descriptive statsistics\n",
    "\n",
    "You should include plots to support key points. The plots should be of an appropriate type and be labelled (eg axis labels and legends) in such a way that the reader can understand them directly, without needing to refer to your code or to the data table.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should include subheadings. Where possible, subheadings summarize the key findings (eg 'older patients have longer hospital stays') rather than describing the analysis (ef 'association between age and length of stay')"
