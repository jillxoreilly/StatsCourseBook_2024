# Learning Objectives

Here is what you should understand after this week

## Concepts

* In statistical testing, a data *sample* is used to represent the *population* from which it is drawn
* For small samples, outliers may render a sample unrepresentative
* Replacing data with their ranks mitigates the effect of outliers on statistical tests


## Python skills

After this week you should be able to carry out, using `scipy.stats:`

* Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon Rank-Rum test (independent samples)
* Wilcoxon sign-rank test (paired samples)
* Spearman's rank correlation including obtaining a $p$-value
