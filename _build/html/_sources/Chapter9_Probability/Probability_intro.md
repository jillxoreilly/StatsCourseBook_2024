# Probability

This chapter introduces formal probablity theory. Probabilty theory is the mathematical basis for all statstical tests.

Most statistics courses cover this material at the start as it is considered 'foundational' (ie, you need to understand it to understand why statistical tests work. 

I am taking a punt on the notion that you had enough familiarity with the ideas of probability theory (from school, or general knowledge) to get through the chapters so far. So our job now is to formalize those ideas with some mathematical notation and equations.
