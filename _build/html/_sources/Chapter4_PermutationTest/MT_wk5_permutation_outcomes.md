# Learning Objectives

Here is what you should understand after this week

## Conceptual

After this week you should:

<ul>
<li> Understand what a null and alternative hypothesis are
<li> Understand the procedure for null hypothesis testing (ie assume
the null is true, work out the probability of our test statistic
arising)
<li> Understand the terms Type I Error and Type II Error
<li> Understand that the null distribution is the distribution of the
test statistic under the null hypothesis
<li> Understand that the null distribution can be estimated
empirically by permutation of the sample
<li> Understand which datapoints may be permuted to test for:
<ul>
<li> A difference of means in independent samples
<li> A mean (pairwise) difference in paired samples
<li> A correlation
</ul>
<ul>

The conceptual material is covered in the lecture and recapped in the worked
examples in Python

## Python skills

The key skill practiced this week is running a permutation test using
<tt>scipy.stats</tt>

To do that, you will need to be able to create very simple functions

You will also see how to build permutation tests 'from scratch' and
should understand how to do this but would not bbe expected to create
a totally new example yourself



This material is covered in the Jupyter Notebooks in this section
