# t-Test

This week we introduce the most popular statistical test of all time, the t-test!


## Tasks for this week

**Conceptual material** is covered in the lecture. In addition to the
live lecture, you can find lecture videos on Canvas.

Please work through the guided exercises in this section (everything
*except* the page labelled "Tutorial Exercises") in advance of
the computer-based tutorial session.

To complete the guided exercises you will need to either:

* open the pages in Google Colab (simply click the Colab button on each page), or
* download them as Jupyter Notebooks to your own computer and work
with them locally (eg in JupyterLab)

If you find something difficult or have questions, you can discuss
with your tutor in the computer-based tutoral session.

This week is particularly heavy on conceptual material, so please do
discuss the guided exercises and tutorial exercises with your tutor to
make sure you understand
