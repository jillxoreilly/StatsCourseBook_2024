# Effect size (Pearson's r)

The effect size for a correlation is quantified simply by the correlation coefficient Pearson's $r$.

Remember an effect size tells us how large the effect of interest is, in comparison to random variation.

In the case of a correlation, the effect of interest is the relationship between $x$ and $y$ along the best-fit line $y=mx+c$, whilst the random variation is the spread of data about this line

Pearson's $r$ quantifies exactly that - remember this figure from the section on Correlation in the chapter on **Describing Data** (you may like to look back at it):

**The correlation coefficient $r$ is always a number between 1 (perfect positive correlation; all points on a line) and -1 (perfect negative correlation)**

Correlation gives us a 'pure' measure of the strength of the relationship between $x$ and $y$ (corrected for the spread within $x$ and $y$ independently).
