# Learning Objectives

Here is what you should understand after this week

## Conceptual

After this week you should:

* Understand what a null and alternative hypothesis are
* Understand the procedure for null hypothesis testing (ie assume the null is true, work out the probability of our test statistic arising)
* Understand that the null distribution is the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis
* Understand that the null distribution can be estimated empirically by permutation of the sample


* Understand which datapoints may be permuted to test for:
    * A difference of means in independent samples
    * A mean (pairwise) difference in paired samples
    * A correlation

The conceptual material is covered in the lecture and recapped in the worked examples in Python

## Python skills

The key skill practiced this week is running a permutation test using
`scipy.stats`

To do that, you will need to be able to create very simple functions





This material is covered in the Jupyter Notebooks in this section
