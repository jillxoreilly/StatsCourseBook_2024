# Non-parametric equivalents of the t-test

The t-test is a test for difference of means. It is suitable for data
drawn from a normal distribution, even if the sample size is small.

If the data are *not* drawn from a normal distribution, or we cannot be
confident that they are, we can use a permutation test (see last week)
or a non-parametric test based on ranks.

Just as we have different versions of the t-test, we have different rank-based
non-paramteric tests for

* independent samples
* paired samples
