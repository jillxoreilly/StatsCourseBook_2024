    "The output from python provides confidence intervals too. The 95% confidence intervals for the odds ratio are 1.29 – 1.68. \n",
    "\n",
    "* For age, the odds ratio tells us that for each additional year the odds of answering ‘true’ are 0.02 (or 2%) lower (using 1-0.98 for the effect size). Here I will not interpret ‘colsci’ as it is not statistically significant. \n",

    "While a linear regression uses the method of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to fit the model, logistic regression uses the *Maximum Likelihood Estimation* method. This method uses the values of the model parameters that are most consistent with the observed data, so that with the intercept and slope values estimated in the model, the observed data have a greater chance of occurring than with any other estimated values (See Agresti, Chapter 5). \n",

    "Like in linear regression $R^2$, we use a ‘baseline’ model with no $x$ variables (predicting the outcome that occurs most often), and compare the log-likelihood after adding the $x$ variables. The likelihood-ratio test, (in python the LLR $p$-value) produces a $p$-value so that we can tell if our model is statistically significant. Low p-values (below 0.05) tell us that the model with the $x$s is significantly better at predicting the outcome than the baseline model. "
