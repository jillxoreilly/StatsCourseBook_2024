# Regression

We now move onto the next section of this course. The remaining six lectures (3 this term and 3 in Trinity Term) will be given by Lindsay Richards. Hi!

This week we introduce regression analysis. We will discuss how regression relates to correlation and covariance, and will cover the line of best fit, residuals, and the regression equation. You can expect plenty of emphasis on concepts and interpretation in this part of the course, as well as some new Python code
