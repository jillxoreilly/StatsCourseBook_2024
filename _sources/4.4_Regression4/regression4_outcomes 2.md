#  Learning Objectives

## Conceptual

After this week, you should be able to:

*	Understand how and when to apply ANOVA.
*	Understand the key concepts including mean squares and the $F$-statistic.
*	Specify hypotheses and interpret the outcome of the test.
*	Understand how ANOVA relates to regression.
*	Understand when to use, and how to interpret, the Kruskal-Wallis test.


These points will be covered in the lecture.

## Python Skills

We will be working with `statsmodels` in Python again. This week, you will learn to:

*	Run one-way and two-way ANOVAs and interpret the output.
*	Compare the ANOVA table to the regression table.
*	Run a Kruskal-Wallis test and interpret the output.
