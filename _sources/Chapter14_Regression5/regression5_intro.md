# Logistic Regression

Until now, we have been looking at *linear* regression. We now move onto *logistic* regression, which is a form of regression for modelling binary outcome measures. One major difference between linear and logistic regression is in the interpretation of the coefficients, which in logistic regression take the form of *log odds* or *odds ratios*.
