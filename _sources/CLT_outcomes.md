# Learning Objectives

## Conceptual


After this week you should be able to:

<ul>
<li> Define the sampling distribution of a statistic (such as the sample mean or proportion) 
<li> Define standard error and explain its relationship to standard deviation
<li> Explain how the standard error depends on sample size n
<li> State the Central Limit Theorem and know when it applies
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Define a confidence interval
<li> Calculate a 95% or 99% confidence interval for the mean of a
large sample
</ul>


This material is covered in the lecture and recapped in the worked
examples in Python

## Python skills

This week there is an emphasis on simulating the process of drawing a
large number of samples from a parent distribution

The key skill practiced this week is building a <tt>for</tt> loop to
repeat a process many times
(such as drawing a random sample and getting its mean)

You might need to change some variable (such as sample
size n) on each pass through the loop.

Additional new(ish) Python skills:

<ul>
<li> Plot an expected distribution such as a curve from the function
<tt>stats.norm.pdf()</tt> over a histogram of simulated data
<li> Plot a Q-Q plot
</ul>

This material is covered in the Jupyter Notebooks in this section
