# Hypothesis testing roundup

At this point it may be helpful to review some key ideas about hypothesis testing, and the relationship between sample and population. 

The following videos are from last year's version of the course so there may be a couple of unfamiliar terms, or mentions of 'the exercise you did last week' (which you haven't heard of!) but I think overall these could be a useful resource for revising some ideas in hypothesis testing

**Note** in some of these videos I talk about confidence intervals; these are a useful concept but haven't been covered on the course so far so feel free to let the idea wash over you if it isn't making sense

### Sample vs population

As scientists we always work with a **sample** of data, but we are interested in generaliing our results to the wider population.

### What is the sampling distribution of the mean?

To determine statistical significance, we need to understand how much our test statistic would vary due to random chance in other samples from the same population.

* The **sampling distribution of the mean** is the distribution you wuld get if you took many different samples of sie $n$ from the population and calculated each of our means
* The **null distribution** is the sampling distribution of the mean (or another test statistic) that we would expect to get if the null hypothesis were true

### Estimating the sampling distribution of the mean from a sample

The estimated sampling distribution of a statistic (based on our sample) is not identical to the distribution we would get if we hhad lots of different samples fromm the *actual* population.

### The $t$ distribution

The $t$ distribution, the topic of the week, is a specific case of an estimated sampling distribution of the mean
