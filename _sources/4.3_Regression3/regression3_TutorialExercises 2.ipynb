    "# Tutorial Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial exercises this week will form the basis of your next hand-in assignment. You will be using real data that were collected in 2019 about people’s perception of their social standing and their happiness. These data were collected online by the well-respected polling company YouGov. The data are intended to be representative of the UK population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: as well as completing these exercises, it’s a good idea to review the instructions for the assignment ahead of the tutorial, so that you can check you understanding with your tutor. \n",
    "\n",
    "The variables are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\t`happy` (a continuous measure ranging from 0-10, where higher scores are greater happiness)\n",
    "*\t`ladder` (a continuous measure of 1-11 where participants rate themselves in their standing in society, where the lowest rung on the ladder was labelled “bottom of society” and the top rung as “top of society”)\n",
    "*\t`age` (a continuous measure in years)\n",
    "*\t`marital` (a categorical measure of marital status with three categories) \n",
    "*\t`work` (a categorical measure of working status with four categories)\n",
    "*\t`educ` ( a categorical measure of educational qualifications summarised into 3 categories)\n",
    "*\t`sex` (male, female)\n",
    "*\t`leftout` (a categorical variable in which people state whether they agree or disagree that they feel left out of society)\n",
    "*\t`income` (a categorical variable with four categories)\n",
    "*\t`region` (a categorical variable with twelve categories)\n",
