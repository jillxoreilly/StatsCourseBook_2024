# Describing data

This week we cover the topic of 'describing data' from the perspective
that <i>data answer questions</i>.


As scientists, we collect data in order to try and learn something about the natural world (in the case of psychologists, how the mind works). When describing the data we have collected, we must be mindful that our description effectively answers the question of interest. For example:

<ul>
<li>When giving descriptive statistics, we must consider how different
summary statistics can be interpreted in order to choose the correct
ones to report for our particular study.
<li>When choosing a plot type, we should be mindful of what we want the reader to be able to perceive about the data from the plot (a relationship between two variables? the number of peaks in the distribution? or the difference between a large number of distributions?). 
</ul>
 

The emphasis of the lecture is on a conceptual understanding of the
material that should equip you to make good choices when describing
your own data.

To keep the focus on the conceptual level, in this lecture and the
entire lecture series, I have not gone through worked examples in the core lecture videos.

Instead, Python exercises are provided for you to work through to
learn about how we obtain descriptive statistics.
