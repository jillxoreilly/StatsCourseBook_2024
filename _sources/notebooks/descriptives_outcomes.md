# Learning Objectives

## Conceptual

This week we are thinking about how to describe data â€“ covering measures of centre (mean, median, mode), measures of spread (variance, standard deviation, inter quartile range, percentiles), and description of distributions (shape and skew).

After this week you should understand:

<ul>
<li> Conceptual difference between the mean, median and mode, and when each is used
<li> Conceptual difference between the standard deviation and interquartile range and when each is used
<li> Why measure based on ranks (median and inter quartile range) are robust to outliers
<li> Why the mean is useful in predicting the behaivour of large samples
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Describe the shape and skew of a distribution in words (based on viewing a data plot)
<li> Make predictions about the shape of a distribution from summary statistics (for example, what is the skew for a distribution where the median is higher than the mean?)
<li> Appreciate common factors affecting the shape of distributions (what happens when a measure can only take values above zero for example). 
</ul>

This material is covered in the lecture (also in the lecture videos on Canvas)

## Python skills

We are working with <tt>Pandas</tt> dataframes and some of the associated methods

After this week you should be able to:

<ul>
<li> Read data from a <tt>.csv</tt> file into a <tt>pandas</tt> dataframe using <tt>pandas.read_csv</tt>
<li> View a dataframe using <tt>display()</tt> including viewing only certain rows (selected by row index or condition)
<li> Obtain a set of descriptive statsitics using <tt>describe()</tt>, including for a subset of rows or columns
<li> Obtain specific descriptive statistics using methods such as <tt>mean()</tt>, <tt>count()</tt>, <tt>quantile()</tt>, including for a subset of rows or columns
<li> Remove rows from a dataframe (eg those corresponding to bad data records)
<li> Replace values in a dataframe with new values or with <tt>NaN</tt>

This material is covered in the Jupyter Notebooks in this section
