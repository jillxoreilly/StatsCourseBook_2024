# Welcome 

<b> Welcome to Statistics and Data Science </b>

In this course you will learn how we draw inferences and conclusions
about the world from samples of data

The course is taught using Python


<b>DataCamp</b>

As preparation for the course and support throughout, we use the
online coding environment DataCamp. DataCamp is a great way to learn
coding as it is interactive - it takes you through tasks step by step, offers you hints
and points out where you have made errors. There are also video
tutorials on key topics.

I strongly encourage you to use DataCamp for the following:

* **preparatory work** (see notes in Chapter 1)
* **support** with coding syntax throughout the course
* **extension work** DataCamp has data science courses that will take you
  beyond the scope of this course. DataCamp offers 350+ courses by expert instructors on topics such as importing data, data visualization, and machine learning. Theyâ€™re constantly expanding their curriculum to keep up with the latest technology trends and to provide the best learning experience for all skill levels.

A big shout out to DataCamp for providing free access for students on
this course, thanks!
