# Learning Objectives

## Conceptual

This week we are thinking about how to describe data â€“ covering measures of centre (mean, median, mode), measures of spread (variance, standard deviation, inter quartile range, percentiles), and description of distributions (shape and skew).

After this week you should understand:

* Conceptual difference between the mean, median and mode, and when each is used
* Conceptual difference between the standard deviation and interquartile range and when each is used
* Why measures based on ranks (median and inter quartile range) are robust to outliers
* Why the mean is useful in predicting the behaivour of large samples

* Describe the shape and skew of a distribution in words (based on viewing a data plot)
* Make predictions about the shape of a distribution from summary statistics (for example, what is the skew for a distribution where the median is higher than the mean?)
* Appreciate common factors affecting the shape of distributions (what happens when a measure can only take values above zero for example). 

* Understand what correlation is, and what correlated data look like ona  scatter plot
* Understand the assumptions of Pearson's correlation  coefficient, and when to use Spearman's and Pearson's correlation coefficients

This material is covered in the lecture (also in the lecture videos on Canvas)

## Python skills

We are working with `Pandas` dataframes and some of the associated methods

After this week you should be able to:

* Read data from a <tt>.csv</tt> file into a `pandas` dataframe using `pandas.read_csv()`
* View a dataframe using `df.display()` including viewing only certain rows (selected by row index or condition)
* Obtain a set of descriptive statsitics using `df.describe()`, including obbtaining statistics for a subset of rows or columns
* Obtain specific descriptive statistics using methods such as `df.mean()`, `df.count()`, `df.quantile()`, and `df.corr()`  including for a subset of rows or columns

This material is covered in the Jupyter Notebooks in this section

There is also a DataCamp module on `Pandas` - you may wish to revisit this for further Python practice
