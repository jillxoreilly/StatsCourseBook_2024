#  Learning Objectives

## Conceptual

After this week, you should be able to:

*	Understand the difference between observational data and an experiment.
*	Understand the idea of a ‘natural experiment’ and how these are similar and different to other experiments.
*	Understand exactly how an experiment helps to establish causality.
*	Understand the limits of observational data for establishing causality.

These points will be covered in the lecture.


## Python Skills

There is no new Python code this week. In your tutorial, you will be consolidating your skills and preparing for the exam by doing a practice exam question.
