# Regression - Statistical Tests

This week we get into some of the statistics associated with regression analysis. These are the ones that tell us whether the coefficients are statistically significant, how well our model fits the data, and whether the regression assumptions have been met.

## Tasks for this week
Conceptual material is covered in the lecture. In addition to the live
lecture, you can find the lecture recording and additional materials
on Canvas.

Please work through the guided exercises in this section (everything
except the page labelled “Tutorial Exercises”) in advance of the
computer-based tutorial session.

The tutorial exercises for this week will form the basis of your hand-in assignment.
