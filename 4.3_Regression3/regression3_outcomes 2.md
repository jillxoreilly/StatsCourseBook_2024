#  Learning Objectives

Conceptual

After this week, you should be able to:

* Understand the equation and interpretation of R-squared and the Root-Mean-Square-Error
* Understand the equation for finding the standard error and how to interpret the significance test on the slope
* Understand the standard error, t-statistic, and significance level in the regression table.
* Assess whether regression assumptions have been met.

These points will be covered in the lecture.

Python Skills

We will be working with `statsmodels` in Python again. This week, you will learn to:

*	Explore model assumptions using graphs in Python
*	Find p-value and significance levels on intercept and slope
*	Find R-squared and RMSE and interpret
