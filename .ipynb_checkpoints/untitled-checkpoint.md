# Preparing a report

As a researcher or data scientist, your ultimate 'product' is often quite a compact report summarizzing the key findings from your survey or experiment. For example, a research scientist might produce a journal article with just 3-4 figures ot convey the results of a complex study. A statistician or data scientist would produce a report of a few hundred words for a client (such as a company CEO, civil servant or politician).

However, the production of the report is preceded by an exploratory phase in which you need to get to know the data, in order to work out what to put in the report. In the case of scientific research, this phase typically lasts several months (!).

Therefore there are two distinct phases to data analysis:

* Understanding the dataset yourself - this involves making lots of quick plots and descriptive statistics to
    * check for outliers
    * find out the data distributions
    * look for differences between categories
    * look for associations between variables
<br>    
* Preparing a report for a reader - this involves a focus on readability and the reader
    * explain any key features of the dataset 
    * highlighting key results with descriptive statistics and figures
    * explain your comclusions succinctly
    
To write a good report, it is essential to consider the **reader** and the **message** or conclusions

The **reader** is (in most cases) not statistically trained, therefore:
* non-technical language should be used as far as possible
* jargon (especially things like incomprehensible variable names take straight from a data table) should be avoided.

All figures and statistics given are there to **support your message** or conclusions.
* figure titles should summarize the point being made by the figure 
* figures should be accompanies by text explaining what the reader is supposed to learn from the figure
* figures should be well labelled and 'tweaked' (use of colours, range of axes, etc etc) to make your point as clearly as possible

In these tutorial exercises, you will complete some guided tasks (and some open-ended ones) to explore the dataset for yourself.

For the hand-in assignment, you will produce a report on the same dataset for a specified reader.
