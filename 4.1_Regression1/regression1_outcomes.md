# Learning Objectives

## Conceptual

This week we have introduced regression analysis.

After this week, you should be able to: 
*	Know how regression relates to the methods of correlation and covariance.
*	Understand the "Least Squares" concept.
*	Distinguish a dependent from an independent variable.
*	Understand the form and interpretation of the regression equation.
*	Recognise and understand the equations for calculating regression
coefficients.

These points will be covered in the lecture.

## Python Skills

Starting this week, and for the rest of the course, we will be working
with the `statsmodels` package in Python.

This week, you will learn to:
*	Run a simple regression model in Python.
*	Understand the model outputs including the intercept and slope coefficients, and the sum of residuals.
*	Identify potential outliers and exclude them from your analysis.
*	Plot a regression line over a scatterplot.

We will also be re-capping some of the valuable skills you learned for handling real-world data (data cleaning and finding outliers), as well as other skills relevant to regression modelling, namely making scatter plots, and finding correlations.
