# Regression Concepts

Let’s begin with a ‘toy’ dataset, by which I mean a dataset with a small number of data points so that we can easily see what is going on.

There are only 10 data points here, but the data are real! These are country average levels of life satisfaction and GDP per capita for a selection of countries in Europe in 2020.

I downloaded these data from the Our World in Data website for all of Europe, then randomly selected 10 countries. There are a lot of real-world studies on the topic of the relationship between wealth and happiness.

Here, we’ll focus on the concepts. We’ll get onto the Python code for regression later.

First, we can examine the relationship visually in a scatter plot:

* What can you say about the relationship from eyeballing the scatter plot?

There is a positive relationship

The correlation between life satisfaction and GDP per capita is 0.65 meaning, as you recall from topic 4, that there is a positive relationship of moderate strength. As GDP increases, so does average life satisfaction.

* The regression equation takes the form $\hat{y}=a+bx$ where $\hat{y}$̂ (known as “y-hat”) is the predicted value of $y$, $a$ is the intercept, and $b$ is the slope. What are the $y$ and $x$ in the life satisfaction example?

In our example, $y$ is life satisfaction and $x$ is GDP per capita
