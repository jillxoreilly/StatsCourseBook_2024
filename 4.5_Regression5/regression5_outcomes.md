#  Learning Objectives

## Conceptual

After this week, you should be able to:

*  Understand the principles underpinning logistic regression, including the logit transformation.
*	Recognise and interpret coefficients as log odds and odds ratios.
*	Be able to convert the output of logistic regression into predicted probabilities.
*	Understand the fit statistics for logistic regression.

These points will be covered in the lecture.

## Python Skills

We will be working with `statsmodels` in Python again. This week, you will learn to:

*	Fit logistic regression models in Python.
*	Request model output in odds ratios.
*	Convert the model output into predicted probabilities.
*	Interpret basic model fit statistics.
*	Understand, and work with, the ‘effective sample’ in statistical models.
